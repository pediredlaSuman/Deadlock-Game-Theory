### Deadlock Game Theory
---
**Game theory** is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers. Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science and biology.

### Game Representations
---
#### **Players**:who are decision makers
People? Governments? Companies? Somebody employed by a Company?

#### **Actions**:what can the players do?
They can cooperate or defeat or exit game
#### **Payoffs**:what motivates players?
Do they care about some profit? Do they care about other players?
#### **General Deadlock payoff matrix**
Lists what payoffs players get as a function of their actions.
In the deadlock game example, two players face a situation where cooperation yields a higher payoff for both, but defection is the dominant strategy due to the risk of being exploited by the opponent.

|            | Cooperate | Defect    |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Cooperate  | 2, 2      | 0, 0      |
| Defect     | 0, 0      | 1, 1      |

In this matrix:
- If both players cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 2.
- If one player cooperates while the other defects, the cooperator receives a payoff of 0, and the defector receives a payoff of 1.
- If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 0.

### Introduction
---
Introduction:
- Game theory-based deadlock games show situations in which self-interest collides with cooperation, offering complex strategic difficulties.
- Our research explores these dynamics by applying the ideas of strategic interactions and logical decision-making to investigate the best possible solutions.
- To find winning strategies based on payoff analysis and success qualities, a variety of strategies, including Tit for Tat and Always Cooperative, are analyzed.

- Our analysis's findings shed light on practical approaches to decision-making and conflict resolution in impasse situations.
- Applications in real life include deciphering animal behavior's social dynamics and historical occurrences such as the Soviet satellite mishap.

- In the end, becoming proficient in deadlock game theory gives people the tools they need to navigate challenging situations and come out on top.
