- Game theory-based deadlock games show situations in which self-interest collides with cooperation, offering complex strategic difficulties.
- Our research explores these dynamics by applying the ideas of strategic interactions and logical decision-making to investigate the best possible solutions.
- To find winning strategies based on payoff analysis and success qualities, a variety of strategies, including Tit for Tat and Always Cooperative, are analyzed.
- 
  Strategies used here are: Tit for Tat Strategy, Generous Tit for Tat, Sample Strategy, Friedman Strategy, Grasskamp Strategy, Joss Sneaky Strategy, Always Cooperative , Tester Strategy
  
  Prinicples:Rational Decision-Makin, Strategic Interactions, Payoff Matrix, Nash Equilibrium, Cooperative and non-cooperative strategies, Bargaining and Negotiation

- Our analysis's findings shed light on practical approaches to decision-making and conflict resolution in impasse situations.
- Applications in real life include deciphering animal behavior's social dynamics and historical occurrences such as the Soviet satellite mishap.

- In the end, becoming proficient in deadlock game theory gives people the tools they need to navigate challenging situations and come out on top.
