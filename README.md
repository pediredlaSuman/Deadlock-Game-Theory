### Deadlock Game Theory
---
**Game theory** is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers. Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science and biology.

### Game Representations

#### **Players**:who are decision makers
- People? Governments? Companies? Somebody employed by a Company?

#### **Actions**:what can the players do?
- They can cooperate or defeat or exit game
#### **Payoffs**:what motivates players?
- Do they care about some profit? Do they care about other players?
#### **General Deadlock payoff matrix**
- Lists what payoffs players get as a function of their actions.
- In the deadlock game example, two players face a situation where cooperation yields a higher payoff for both, but defection is the dominant strategy due to the risk of being exploited by the opponent.

|            | Cooperate | Defect    |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Cooperate  | 2, 2      | 0, 0      |
| Defect     | 0, 0      | 1, 1      |

In this matrix:
- If both players cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 2.
- If one player cooperates while the other defects, the cooperator receives a payoff of 0, and the defector receives a payoff of 1.
- If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 0.

### Principles Used 

#### Rational Decision-Making:
Is fundamental in game theory, emphasizing selfish behavior to maximize utility. It clarifies strategic reasoning in impasse scenarios, aiding in anticipating and reacting to actions.

#### Strategic Interactions:
Are central in deadlock situations, modeling complex relationships. Game theory helps understand the strategic dynamics at work and predict outcomes to create workable plans.

#### Payoff Matrix:
Provides insights into possible results, quantifying payoffs for decision-making. It offers a methodical approach to evaluate outcomes and predict the conclusion of impasses.

#### Nash Equilibrium:
Denotes stable situations where no party has an incentive to change course unilaterally. Identifying Nash equilibria offers insights into possible outcomes and decision-making dynamics.

#### Cooperative and Non-cooperative Strategies:
Play crucial roles in resolving deadlocks. Cooperative strategies entail collaboration for win-win results, while non-cooperative techniques involve autonomous decision-making. Understanding their dynamics affects the chances of coming to agreements.

#### Bargaining and Negotiation:
Are essential for resolving deadlocks, allowing parties to reach agreements. Modeled by game theory, they consider variables like bargaining power and commitment tactics. Understanding these dynamics promotes collaboration and win-win solutions.

### Strategies Used in Deadlock Game Theory

#### Sample Strategy:
- Starts cooperatively to promote cooperation.
- Retaliates against defection but resumes collaboration for cooperation.
- Rewards cooperative behavior and penalizes defection.
- Demonstrates repercussions of non-cooperation through retribution.
- Adjusts between cooperation and retaliation as needed.

#### Friedman Strategy:
- Starts with collaboration and mirrors opponent's move.
- Rewards continuous cooperation.
- Outlines penalties for malfunctioning as retaliation against defection.
- Encourages collaboration and trust by mirroring opponent's actions.
- Responds predictably to opponent's actions.

#### Tit for Tat Strategy:
- Copies adversary's prior action for reciprocity and trust.
- Acts cooperatively in return for cooperation.
- Mirrors opponent's move in retaliation to defection.
- Adjusts behavior to preserve stability and balance.

#### Joss Sneaky Strategy:
- Cooperates initially, then mimics opponent's move with slight misprediction.
- Gains strategic advantage by creating ambiguity and confusion.
- Modifies behavior to take advantage of opponent's actions.
- Increases unpredictability through deceit.

#### Graaskamp Strategy:
- Starts with cooperation to build trust.
- Defects periodically to increase profit.
- Uses hybrid defection and cooperation for tactical advantage.
- Modifies tactics based on player reactions.

#### Tester Strategy:
- Cooperates initially to establish rapport.
- Modifies plan based on opponent's actions.
- Reacts with cooperation or defection based on opponent's behavior.
- Adjusts defection timing for maximum reward.

#### Always Cooperative Strategy:
- Cooperates consistently to create cooperative atmosphere.
- Puts collaboration ahead of revenge.
- Establishes connection and confidence with opponent.

#### Generous Tit for Tat Strategy:
- Encourages cooperation by copying opponent's move.
- Acts cooperatively toward opponent.
- Forgives opponent's sporadic defections.
- Strikes balance between forgiveness and reciprocity.

Introduction:
- Game theory-based deadlock games show situations in which self-interest collides with cooperation, offering complex strategic difficulties.
- Our research explores these dynamics by applying the ideas of strategic interactions and logical decision-making to investigate the best possible solutions.
- To find winning strategies based on payoff analysis and success qualities, a variety of strategies, including Tit for Tat and Always Cooperative, are analyzed.
